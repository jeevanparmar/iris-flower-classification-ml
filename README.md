# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning web application** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.  
It demonstrates the **complete ML lifecycle** — data handling, model training, evaluation, and deployment — with a modern, user-friendly web interface.

The application classifies Iris flowers into:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

using supervised learning techniques.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given four flower measurements:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

the goal is to accurately predict the **species of the Iris flower** and display the result along with the corresponding flower image.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Dataset**: Iris Dataset (scikit-learn)
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Problem Type**: Multi-class Classification
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score

The trained model is serialized using `pickle` and integrated into a Flask web application for real-time inference.
